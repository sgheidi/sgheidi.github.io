Another slight variation for doing the above is creating a copy of the board at each position and evaluating the copy, to avoid the undo. This is the pure minimax approach of traversing all nodes, and it would imply take too long to search all positions, even at a low depth. An optimization of this, which \u03b1-\u03b2 pruning uses, is to notice that not all nodes of the game tree need to be searched. That is, if you know a given move leads to a position worse than the current, you do not need to search any further positions. These entire subtrees can be discarded, which is known as ",r.a.createElement("i",null,"pruning"),".
